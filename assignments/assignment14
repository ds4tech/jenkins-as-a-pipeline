Different levels of testing Job-DSL code

1. Execute ./gradlew clean build in the root of this project and see whether some tests are failing if so, try to fix the tests.

1.1 Check that you have solution for assignment13 available in the jobs/assignments and try to execute LightAllAssignmentsScriptsSyntacticCorrectnessSpecification
from IDE (should be executed without gradle for the speed reasons). Compare it results' with AllAssignmentsScriptsSyntacticCorrectnessSpecification and try to
tell why only one of them fails.

2. Look at ExampleDSLScriptRegressionSpecification and src/resources/com.szymonhoma/example_for_regression_dsl_script.groovy, try to execute these test
from the IDE (a gradle execution must be used), try to break the test by changing any part of the dsl script and see the output.

3. Add a new test similar to the ExampleDSLScriptRegressionSpecification, that will use any other script and try to generate xmls for it, by using
./gradlew clean build -PoutputMissingXml=true
