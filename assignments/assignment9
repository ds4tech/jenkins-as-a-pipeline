In the previously developed pipeline, add long running step to be executed in parallel with the acceptance tests (after the deployment to test environment).
Try adding more of such steps to see how they are drawn in the pipeline

TIP: in order to simulate long running task, you can use shell command like "sleep 30", which makes the job to run for 30 seconds
