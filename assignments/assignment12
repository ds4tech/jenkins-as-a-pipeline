In the previously developed pipeline, change the step waiting for long running steps in such a way that does not occupy jenkins executors.
Keep the previous behaviour of not letting the pipeline to move forward, before the long running step won't be finished.
Modify the logic to fail the step when the long running step has failed as well.
Start from enabling the waiting step to be rebuild manually, instead of automatically rebuilding it


TIP: Check decumentation for groovy postbuild manager object (like manager.buildFailure())
TIP: Check for allowRebuild() option in pipeline view to enable rebuilding
TIP: use com.szymonhoma.util.Scripts to load script, for better development experience
